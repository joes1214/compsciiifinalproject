# Computer Science II Final Project
Final Project for my Computer Science 161 class.

The purpose of this project is to expose me to classes and header files.

#### Problem Specification 
A certain corporation has four regions, each responsible for sales to a different geographical location. Design a DivSales class that keeps sales data for a division with the following members:

* A Data member that holds the region name
* An array with four elements for holding four quarters of sales figures for the region
* A private static variable for holding the total corporate sales for all divisions for the region
* A null destructor
* A constructor that initializes the name to null "" and quarters to 0
* A member function that prompt the user to enter the region name and sales for four quarters for that region. The value entered should be added to the static variable that holds the yearly corporate sales.
* A member function that returns the region name.
* A member function that returns the total sales for any given region
* A member function that returns the total sale for all regions
* Extra Credit: At the end, the total of each quarter for the regions is preinted by accessing a member function to accumulate the quarters.
